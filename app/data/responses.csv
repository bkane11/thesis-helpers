The map overlay takes a regional analysis & places it SPECIFICALLY on aspects.  While this may be perfectly accurate, if the analysis of the North Cascades West of Crest is that the stability is high and this is due to wind loading on lee-aspects the localized wind direction can vary across regions and load slightly different aspects than the map may indicate.  Such as a regional west wind loading eastern slopes - the wind in the Artist Point region (Bagley Lakes etc) may still be coming from Baker Lake (South) and over ridges loading Nothern Aspects. 

I REALLY like the idea of the map overlay, especially from a trip planning position but I am afraid that it over simplifies avalanche and snowpack dynamics and conditions.  I may be wrong about the localized wind etc, & if that is the case the map overlay is extremely cool. In addition it is nice to show exposure from above slopes etc.  Really a combination of all 3 is the best.

I also thought that the color differentiations and the way the map was constructed wasn't entirely clear.  On some of the previous maps, high avy danger was shown hanging above an area rated with a lower danger.  Does that mean that the forecast is saying that the area below is safe from run outs, or just that the lower area is unlikely to slide?

However, I ended up having to unstrap my snowboard and hike a considerable distance. Not fun.

I occasionally speed in my car. 80mph-100mph for short distances. Only on the freeway (I-5), when traveling a fair distance away, and when there's no one to practically no one else driving around me.

The text and danger rose are good for a general daily update; however, I am assuming the map is taking into consideration historical avalanche paths existing in the survey area and applying the daily details from the rose and text.  Interestingly, it would be nice if a computerized topographical model could be generated that would be able to identify areas of extreme, high, considerable, moderate, and low based on previous historical avalanche databases, slide paths and frequency, weather conditions, and current conditions identified by the danger rose and daily forecast wind, precip, weather and trend as discussed in the text. As a result, you have the potential for a multicolored topographical map with different areas rated based on their aspect, steepness, existing path or runout location, historical frequency to avalanche, potential runout, and current daily conditions and trends. Obviously these map ratings would change daily, but it would be a very powerful tool for route finding and decision making based on ALL available historical and current predictive elements.
